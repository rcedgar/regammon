## Introduction

**RE**gammon is a re-implementation from scratch of Gerry Tesauro's [TG-gammon algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD-Gammon). The code includes training of a deep neural network by self-play using reinforcement learning, and a GUI for playing the game interactively on Windows. The code was written as a learning exercise; it is provided as-is with no documentation or support.
